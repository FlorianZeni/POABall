Multiplayer Haxball remake

This project was created as the final project of a Object Oriented Programming Class by Florian Zeni, Serge Halablian and Stephen Joulia.

It is a real-time multiplayer game mostly copied from the online browser game Haxball. 
It was entirely coded in Java using the LibGDX and Kryonet libraries.

The goal of this project was to implement real-time multiplayer solutions such as client prediction and server reconciliation as well as interpolation.
